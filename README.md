# brain commute
A graph theoretical property called commute time is calculated from structural data in an attempt to better link brain structure to function. Results are presented in the following paper:

* the main directory contains the scripts to analzye dMRI and fMRI data.
* `data/` includes processed dMRI and fMRI data for the HCP Young Adult dataset only.
* `simulation/` contains scripts and data to generate and analyze results from simulations of brain function.
* `utlts/` contains the underlying supporting scripts to read in files and properly calculate commute time and functional connectivity.
